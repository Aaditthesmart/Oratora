# Oratora 🎤

Oratora is an AI-powered public speaking coach that helps people improve **how they speak**, not what they say.

Instead of focusing on grammar or vocabulary, Oratora analyzes **delivery** — pauses, silence, pace, confidence, and presence — using audio and video signals. It shows speakers the exact moments where they lose flow or confidence and provides clear, actionable feedback to improve.

Most public speaking tools judge words.
Oratora judges **delivery**.
